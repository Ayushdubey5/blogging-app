 Project Description:
I built BlogSphere, a responsive and user-friendly blog listing application using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to create, view, and read blog posts with ease — offering a smooth and modern user experience without needing a backend server.

⚙️ Core Features:
📝 Add Blog Page – A clean form where users can add a blog post with a title, content, date, and optional image URL.

📄 Home Page – Displays all submitted blog posts with a summary, date, and preview image (if added).

🔍 Blog Detail Page – View full blog content via dynamic routing using the blog’s unique ID.

🖼️ Image Support (Bonus) – Users can add a link to an image to display alongside their blog post.

💾 Local Persistence – All blog data is stored using localStorage, so it remains during the session.

📱 Responsive Design – Fully responsive and mobile-friendly UI using Tailwind CSS.

⚡ No External APIs – Entirely frontend-based for fast interaction and easy deployment.

💡 Key Technical Highlights:
Frontend: React with Next.js Pages & Routing

Styling: Tailwind CSS for fast and modern UI development

State Management: useState, useEffect

Data Persistence: localStorage (avoiding backend complexity)

Deployment: Vercel

Version Control: Git & GitHub
